	<h3>public transportation</h3>

	<p>columbia university campus is reachable via public transportation from major new york city airports (jfk, newark and laguardia) and train stations. the jfk airport airtrain has connection to the <a href=”http://web.mta.info/maps/submap.html”> new york subway</a> system. there is <a href=”http://www.njtransit.com/sf/sf_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TrainSchedulesTo”>new jersey transit</a> train service from newark airport to pennsylvania station. bus service directly from laguardia airport to columbia, the M60 city bus, is also available. additionally, there is a bus service from jfk, and as well as from newark, to grand central station and the port authority bus terminal.</p>

	<p>five bus lines (M4, M5, M11, M60, M104) and one subway line (the #1 local) serve the columbia neighborhood. the columbia stop is 116th street. do not use express trains #2 and #3, which follow a different route and do not stop at columbia university; if you do, be certain to transfer at 96th street to the #1 local.</p>

	<h3>taxi</h3>

	<p>for visitors coming into laguardia, kennedy, or newark airports, taxi service is available to the campus (about $30 from laguardia; from kennedy a flat rate of $52 plus tolls).</p>
	<h3>train or bus</h3>

	<p>trains to new york arrive at grand central station or pennsylvania station, while buses stop at the port authority bus terminal. visitors arriving at these stations can take either public transportation or a taxi north to the campus.</p>

	<h3>car</h3>

	<p>we strongly advise you not to arrive by car as parking is very limited. cars parking on the street must be moved several times a week for street cleaning. public parking garages close to columbia campus are located at riverside church (120th st. between broadway and riverside drive), corner of 110th st. and broadway, corner of 114th st. and amsterdam avenue and on 122nd st. between broadway and amsterdam avenue. daily parking rates are around $40.</p>
